# Docker on Azure Hands-On Lab - Docker to Helm

## Prerequisites

Needless to say you'll need a laptop! Any OS is fine (Mac is recommended and that's the only machine we've tested on) but make sure the following prerequisites are met prior to the session:

- **Prerequisite 1:** [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) is installed

- **Prerequisite 2:** A valid Azure subscription is available. You can get a trial account from [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).

- **Prerequisite 3:** The `az` CLI from [https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli) is installed on the laptop **OR** you can use the cloud shell as outlined in [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview)

- **Prerequisite 4:** Limits in Azure are set low. File support tickets to get the limits bumped up for your subscriptions. We will need cores (60-100 recommended) to be spun up in West UK which supports some of the configurations.

- **Prerequisite 5:** A familiarity with the Azure portal and the CLI (attended a 1-day Azure course for instance).

- **Prerequisite 6:** A Docker Hub account from [https://hub.docker.com/](https://hub.docker.com/). This is **optional** if you're OK skipping portions of a few exercises.

- **Prerequisite 7:** The labs from [https://github.com/ragsns/dockeronazure.git](https://github.com/ragsns/dockeronazure.git) installed **locally** either via a `git clone` command or by downloading a zip file from the remote repository.


## Samples and General Directions

Each directory is in a separate sub-directory. ***Ensure that you're in the sub-directory when you're working on a particular exercise and you're issuing the CLI commands from the subdirectory pertaining to the exercise.***
